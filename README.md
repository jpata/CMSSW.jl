CMSSW.jl
=======

A toy experiment interfacing CMSSW and Julia (http://julialang.org) through FWLite. Note that this is highly experimental, very much WIP and expected to change.

Julia is a quickly-evolving language for technical computing which executes at near-C speeds on LLVM. CMSSW is a data analysis library widely used at experiments at CERN for HEP data analyses. Traditionally, CMSSW is accessed through the C++ interface, however many analysis tasks can be more succintly expressed and evaluated in a more high level language. Julia provides the much of the flexibility of Python with much of the speed of bare-metal C.

Presently, this library is used throughout at least one CMS analysis.

----

Currently, access to so-called ``EDM-Ntuples`` containing basic types like double, float, int and the corresponding vectors is supported and tested.

Additionally, this library supports basic access methods for CMSSW TTree and TFile types, in particular conversion between Julia DataFrames and CMSSW TTrees.

Further features could be added, but at the moment, this requires manually creating C wrappers for each function using opaque pointers, which can become unwieldy. Therefore, only the most essential CMSSW methods are wrapped at the moment.

Installation
============

* Requirements: the `cmsrel` command must be available (must have done a proper `source cmsset_default.sh`, only available to members of the CMS collaboration for the time being).

To get the package first install Julia, preferrably from the git trunk (see http://julialang.org)

Then add this package to your Julia package database

> Pkg.add("https://github.com/jpata/CMSSW.jl.git")
> Pkg.add("DataFrames") #dependencies
> Pkg.add("DataArrays") #dependencies

followed by

> ./setup.sh;make


Usage
=====

Julia can be called with the proper libraries by using

> ~/.julia/CMSSW/julia

Troubleshooting
===============

### Generic help

Please always check and report the version hash of the main code and all the submodules using

> git fetch origin; git log HEAD..origin/master --oneline; git rev-parse HEAD; git submodule status --recursive

If any of the submodule hashes contain a ***+*** in the beginning, you need to run

> git submodule update --recursive

TODO
====

1. Move to BinDeps
2. Move to Clang.jl
3. Separate CMSSW6 and CMSSW to separate repositories experiment using Cling.
